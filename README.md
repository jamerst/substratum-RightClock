# substratum-RightClock

### This theme is not currently maintained. There are issues with newer Android 10 security updates, use [Tulsadiver's clock mods](https://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-3a/themes/clock-mods-t4024447) instead.

### I may update the theme in the future if I encounter problems with Tulsadiver's mods.

Since Android 9, the status bar clock has been on the left instead of right to supposedly support notches. This makes no sense for phones without a notch, so this theme moves it back.

**This has only been tested on a Pixel 3a running Android 10. Use at your own risk.**
